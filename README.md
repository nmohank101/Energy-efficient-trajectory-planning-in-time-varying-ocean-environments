# Energy-efficient-trajectory-planning-in-time-varying-ocean-environments
We consider the problem of online trajectory design under time-varying environments. We formulate the general trajectory optimization problem within the framework of time-varying constrained convex optimization and propose a novel version of online gradient ascent algorithm that guarantees sublinear offline regret up to the pathlength of the offline solution, cumulative gradient and error in gradient variations. 

In this repository we provide MATLAB implementations to the state-of-the-art energy efficient trajectory planning approaches Stochastic Trajectory Optimzation for Motion Planning (STOMP) [1], Energy Efficient Stochastic Trajectory Optimization (EESTO) [2] along with our proposed Inexact online gradient descent (IOGA) algorithm. A special case of our proposed algorithm has appeared at ICRA'2019 [3].
